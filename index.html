			<h1 class="darkh1">Penetration testing</h1>
			<p>Penetration testing is the most effective strategy for evaluating the security capabilities and needs of a computer network or web application. A penetration test simulates a real attack and provides a rigorous examination of potential and actual vulnerabilities, including software flaws, faulty system configurations, insufficiently robust countermeasures, and more.</p>

		<h1 class="lighth1">ABOUT <span class="highlight">WHITE HAT</span></h1>
		<p>WhiteHat founded in 2013, and we are committed to maintaining Australia's network and website security. From experience, Australia is still in the initial stages of network security, many companies still haven’t realize the importance of protecting their own websites and information transmission. From the company's perspective, if company's web site has been tampered with or company information was leaked, it would not only cause reputational damage, worse situation will be the whole company’s information and personal detail including passwords been disclosure and sell on internet. Which is what we want to stop, and also take the initiative to defense.</p>

		<p>Many major Australian and international companies within Australia are with website and information security problems. We are still in further ‘black box’ testing. However, there are many loopholes we already have, including Vodafone, TPG, Optus which are so renowned brands in Australia. They all have different levels of network security threats, even more, universities, major shopping malls, water companies, electricity suppliers, public transportation systems are also with vulnerabilities. As SME website owners, how is your network security?</p>
